**Hypothesis Testing**: <br>
A hypothesis can be defined as a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. It is 
not the absolute truth but a provisional working assumption. <br>
In statistics, a hypothesis is considered to be a particular assumption about a   
set of parameters of a population distribution. <br>
It is called a hypothesis because it is not known whether or not it is true. <br>
In other words A hypothesis test is a standard procedure for testing a 
claim about a property of a population. <br>


**A/B Testing:** <br>
A/B testing refers to a process of experimentation randomly wherein two or more versions of a variable like web page, page element, etc. are shown to different segments of website visitors or users at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics.<br>

In this project I've solved some Hypothesis testing and A/B testing problems.
